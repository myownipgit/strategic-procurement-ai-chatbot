## 🎯 **ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED & VALIDATED**

### **1. Data Quality Issues** ✅ **CONFIRMED BY ORIGINAL SOURCES**
- **$0.26 radio supplies**: Clearly unrealistic for professional radio equipment
- **$384K network components**: Mixing individual parts with complete enterprise systems
- **Unit of measure inconsistencies**: Per-unit, per-case, per-system pricing mixed together

### **2. Calculation Formula Problems** ✅ **FIXED**
- **Original Formula**: `((MAX - MIN) / AVG) × 100` → Created inflated percentages

### **3. Strategic Insights Preserved** ✅ **MAINTAINED**
- Technology procurement systematic issues **confirmed**
- Vendor consolidation opportunities **maintained**
